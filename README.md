# AML-SemiSupervised-Ensemble
A semi-supervised ensemble model for AML detection, combining supervised and unsupervised learning. It integrates base learners using a blending strategy to improve fraud detection. Trained on SAML-D, it applies feature engineering, cross-validation, and clustering to enhance accuracy while minimizing false positives.
