# Semi-Supervised Ensemble Model for AML

  

This project presents a **semi-supervised ensemble model** for **anti-money laundering (AML) transaction detection**. The model combines **supervised and unsupervised learning** to enhance anomaly detection in financial transactions. It leverages multiple **base learners**, including boosting models, and integrates their predictions using a **blending ensemble strategy** to improve fraud detection accuracy.  

Key Features:  
- Trained on **SAML-D** synthetic transaction dataset.  
- Uses **feature engineering, label encoding, and class imbalance handling** for preprocessing.
- Tested on and **IBM Low Illict** synthetic dataset. 
- Employs **K-fold cross-validation** for robust performance evaluation.  
- Identifies distinct **fraudulent transaction patterns** through clustering.  

This model aims to improve the reliability and effectiveness of **AML systems** by detecting hidden patterns in financial transactions while minimizing false positives.
